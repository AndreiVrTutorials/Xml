# 📄 XML Notes & Learning

Welcome to my personal XML notes repository! ✨  
Here I’ll collect explanations, examples, and tips about **XML (eXtensible Markup Language)** — a standard for storing and transporting structured data.

## 🗂️ What is XML?

**XML** is a markup language that defines rules for encoding documents in a format readable by both humans and machines.  
It’s widely used for **data exchange**, configuration files, web services, and more. 🌐

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🏷️ **Self-descriptive** — Data is wrapped in tags that describe its meaning.  
- 🔗 **Hierarchical structure** — Data is organized in a tree of elements, making it easy to represent complex relationships.  
- ⚡ **Platform-independent** — Can be used across different systems and programming languages.  
- 🛠️ **Extensible** — You can define your own tags to fit any type of data.  
- 🔄 **Supports data exchange** — Commonly used in web services (SOAP, REST), configuration files, and document storage.  
- 📚 **Validated with schemas** — XML Schema or DTD ensures data follows predefined rules.
